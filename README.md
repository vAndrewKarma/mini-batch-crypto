# Local pipestream
Local Pipestream is a lightweight, end-to-end ETL pipeline built for local development. It ingests CSV data, transforms it into a star schema using Python and Pandas, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline is orchestrated with Apache Airflow and runs entirely in Docker, making it perfect for learning and prototyping modern data engineering workflows.
